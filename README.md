## Details

### Global

I am creating a blog in typescript with the vue framework using vite.
The blog needs to be mobile friendly.
The blog will contains posts.
Each post will have a title, content, a list of tags, the creation date

The blog will have a home page, a tag page, a single post page.
The home page has a header banner image on top.
There is a sidebar on the left with a link to the home page, a search input, a list of tags.
The sidebar can be collapse when on mobile.
There is a main container with 6 of the most recent posts.
The tag page has the same template as the home page. In the main container, there will be a list of all post with the current tag.
The single post page has the same template as the home page. In the main container, there will be the content of the post.

I will store my content in json files.

Help me create this project. For now don't give me the code for the blog, we will do it later.
give me a file structure.

I created a blog with typescript but i dont want to store my content in a database, can you give me alternatives? the content is always static and won't be changed often.

### Header

Give me the code for the header vue.
The header will only show a banner image that will take the full width of the site.
the height should not be too much.
Consider it for mobile also.

### Sidebar



### Home

Give me the code for the Home.vue page.
The home
